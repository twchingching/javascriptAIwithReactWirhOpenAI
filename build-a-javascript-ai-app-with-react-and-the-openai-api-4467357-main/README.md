![Build a JavaScript AI App with React and the OpenAI API][lil-thumbnail-url] 

In this course, learn how to integrate the OpenAI API into a JavaScript-based web app. Join instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen as he takes a React-based weather app, adds  a heavy dose of AI, and creates an interactive experience that knows what location you want weather information from, explains the weather data in simple language, and even suggests what to wear. Through this project-based course, Morten teaches you about API integration, user-based authentication, storing user tokens in a ServiceWorker, task-based API configuration, and sending and receiving requests to the API.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:
